For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nif Rails.env.development?\r\n  ApiTaster.routes do\r\n    get '/users'\r\n\r\n    post '/users', {\r\n      :user => {\r\n        :name => 'Fred'\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    get '/users/:id', {\r\n      :id => 1\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    put '/users/:id', {\r\n      :id => 1, :user => {\r\n        :name => 'Awesome'\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    delete '/users/:id', {\r\n      :id => 1\r\n    }\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it! Enjoy! :)\r\n\r\n## Share Params with Test Factories\r\n\r\nIf you use a test factory such as [FactoryGirl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl), you can require your test factories and share the params. For example in FactoryGirl you can use the `attributes_for(:name_of_factory)` method.\r\n\r\n## Obsolete / Mismatched Route Definitions Detection\r\n\r\nAPIs evolve - especially during the development stage. To keep `ApiTaster.routes` in sync with your route definitions, API Taster provides a warning page that shows you the definitions that are obsolete/mismatched therefore you could correct or remove them.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Fo7kQ.png)\r\n\r\n## Use with an Engine\r\n\r\nRails Engines are largely self contained and separated from your main app. Therefore, to use API Taster with an Engine, you would need some extra efforts:\r\n\r\nIn your app Gemfile, you would also need:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem \"jquery-rails\"\r\ngem \"bootstrap-sass\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are hand-picking Rails components, make sure in your `application.rb` you have Sprockets enabled:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire \"sprockets/railtie\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis gem is released under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n[Fred Wu](https://github.com/fredwu), originally built for [Locomote](http://locomote.com.au).\r\n","tagline":"A quick and easy way to visually test out your Rails application's API.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
